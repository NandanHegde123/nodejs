# 🧪 Node.js & Unix Practice Projects – Nandan Hegde

This repository contains a set of mini-projects and code snippets created while learning and experimenting with **Node.js** core modules and **Unix/Linux CLI concepts**.

Each script or subproject focuses on a specific Node.js module or system-level behavior, providing hands-on experience with backend fundamentals and server-side JavaScript.

---

## 🚀 Topics Covered

- 📦 Node.js built-in modules (fs, path, http, events, os, etc.)
- 🧱 Creating and exporting custom modules
- 🛠️ Working with file systems (read, write, append, delete)
- 🌐 Building basic HTTP servers using Node’s native `http` module
- 📁 Directory navigation and manipulation
- 📊 System information using the `os` module
- 🪵 Logging and event-driven architecture with `events`
- 💻 Practicing Unix shell commands (mv, rm, touch, chmod, cat, etc.)
- 🔄 Async programming with callbacks and `fs.promises`

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Language:** JavaScript (ES6+)
- **Runtime:** Node.js
- **Modules:** CommonJS (`require`) + Core Node modules
- **Tools:** Terminal / Unix shell

## ⚙️ How to Run

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/NandanHegde123/nodejs-main.git
cd nodejs-main
```

2. Go into any subfolder and run the script:

```bash
cd 03-http-server
node server.js
```

3. If it's a server, open your browser at:

```
http://localhost:3000
```

or the specified port in the script.

## 🧠 Learning Approach

These exercises were created to understand how Node.js works at the low level — **no frameworks**, no magic — just JavaScript interacting with the operating system.

This includes:
- Core API familiarity
- Event-driven model in practice
- CLI command fluency and scripting

---

## 📌 Notes

- These are foundational practice projects — great for interviews and technical understanding.
- Ideal for anyone learning **Node.js without frameworks** like Express.
- No sensitive information is committed (checked via `.gitignore`).
